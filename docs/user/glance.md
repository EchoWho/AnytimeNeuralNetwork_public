## A High-Level Glance

The following guide introduces some core concepts of TensorPack. In contrast to several other libraries TensorPack contains of several modules to build complex deep learning algorithms and train models with high accuracy and high speed.

### Callbacks

The use of callbacks add the flexibility to execute code during training. These callbacks are triggered on several events such as after each step or at the end of one training epoch.
